As shown in the program above, it is crucial for a programmer to create identifiers that are both descriptive and valid. Although it is not recommended, changing a JavaScript keyword into a capital word such as "New" is one way you can "hack" the system and use identifiers that have the same name as the keywords.

We recommend descriptive names such as "numberOfClients" as it tells the programmer what the variable holds neatly and clearly. Identifiers cannot begin with a digit, and even though underscores or dollar signs can be used, we recommend the use of letters as much as possible to eliminate any unwanted errors in the program.
