Identifiers are basically the name of the variables declared in the program. Identifiers may consist of letters (Unicode), digits, underscore, and dollar signs. Most signs other than these are not allowed to be used in an identifier. Identifiers can only begin with a letter, a dollar sign, or an underscore. A identifier cannot be a JavaScript keyword (e.g. `let`, `var`, `new` etc.) and should use lowerCamelCase. 

Generally speaking, they should be as descriptive as possible and should be neither too long or too short. This will make your program more readable and human-friendly. Identifiers in JavaScript are case-sensitive, so `var sum = 0;` is different from `var SUM = 0;`. The sample program below presents examples of good identifiers and bad identifiers that will throw an error.
