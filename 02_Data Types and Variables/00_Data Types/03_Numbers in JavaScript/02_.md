The sample code above shows four different examples of variables holding numbers. The first line shows an integer declaration as the integer 5 is being declared into the variable `value`. The second line assigns a rough estimate of PI into the variable `pi`. The third line creates a new object using `new Number()`, which essentially does the same thing as the two statements above. Creating Number objects slows down execution speed and complicates the code, so is not recommended. The last variable declaration assigns `biggestNum` to the maximum value of a number, which is approximately 1.8 x 10^308. The minimum value for JavaScript numbers is 5 x 10^-324. This gives you an opportunity to create a variety of programs that use big or small numbers.
