The sample program above shows two examples of string concatenation. The first example prints a welcome message using string variables and the second example prints a person's full name. Although, string concatenation will be explored in-depth later in the course, try to understand how it works so you can use it. String concatenation is pretty straightforward as the '+' operator simply adds two strings together. The unicode examples show how any language can be used in the program and printed correctly on the console. Look up Unicode and see if the languages you speak are supported!
