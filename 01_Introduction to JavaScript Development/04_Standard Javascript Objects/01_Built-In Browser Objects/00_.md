The browser provides some read-only data via:
  - `window`
    - The top node of the DOM tree
    - Represents the browser's window
  - `document`
    - holds information on the current loaded document
  - `screen`
    - Holds the userâ€™s display properties
  - `browser`
    - Holds information about the browser

These objects would only be used if you were to work with HTML and websites.
