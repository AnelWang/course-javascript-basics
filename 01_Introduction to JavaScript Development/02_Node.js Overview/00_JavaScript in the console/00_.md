Node.js is a server-side platform that uses JavaScript. It is a cross-platform JavaScript run-time environment that executes JavaScript code outside the browser. Node.js is built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript Engine and helps create end-to-end apps with JavaScript. You can use Node.js to test & learn JavaScript syntax locally on your terminal.
